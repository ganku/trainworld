            <h2>Coastal Line</h2>
			<section id="section1">
				<p>The train ride from Colombo to Galle along Sri Lanka's scenic coastal railway line is a journey of 
				captivating beauty and cultural charm. Departing from the bustling heart of Colombo, the train hugs the 
				island's western shoreline, offering uninterrupted views of the Indian Ocean's azure waters. 

As the train glides southward, it passes golden sandy beaches fringed with swaying palm trees and quaint fishing 
villages where traditional catamarans dot the shores. The rhythmic sound of the waves crashing against the coast 
accompanies travelers, creating a soothing backdrop to the journey.

Stops at charming towns like Mount Lavinia and Bentota reveal glimpses of Sri Lanka's laid-back coastal life. Here, 
colonial-era architecture, bustling markets, and the aroma of fresh seafood wafting through the air invite passengers 
to pause and explore.

Further south, the scenery transitions into lush greenery with occasional glimpses of lagoons and estuaries teeming 
with birdlife. As the train nears Galle, the striking silhouette of the historic Galle Fort comes into view—a UNESCO 
World Heritage Site with its Dutch colonial charm, cobblestone streets, and vibrant cultural heritage.

The journey concludes at Galle, where the blend of tropical beauty and historic allure leaves travelers enchanted. 
Whether gazing at the endless horizon or absorbing the local rhythms of life at each stop, the Colombo to Galle 
train ride is a serene and unforgettable voyage along Sri Lanka's picturesque southern coast.
