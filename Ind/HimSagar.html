            <h2>The Himalayas to Indian Ocean | Him to Sagar</h2>
			<section id="section1">
				<p>The journey aboard the Himsagar Express begins in Katra, nestled in the serene foothills of the Himalayas. 
				Departing from the sacred town, a gateway to the revered Vaishno Devi shrine, the train embarks on an epic 
				southbound voyage, covering over 3,700 kilometers to Kanyakumari, the southernmost tip of India by the 
				Indian Ocean.
				The train descends from the chilly mountain air of Jammu, passing through Punjab's vibrant mustard 
				fields and Haryana's bustling farmlands. It winds through the Gangetic plains of Uttar Pradesh and 
				Madhya Pradesh, where ancient cities and fertile landscapes come into view. Maharashtra's urban sprawl 
				and industrial hubs mark a shift, leading to Telangana's rocky plateaus and Andhra Pradesh's expansive 
				plains.
				As the train ventures further south, the landscapes transform. Kerala's lush backwaters and 
				Tamil Nadu's temple-dotted countryside offer a warm, tropical embrace. The final stretch to 
				Kanyakumari reveals a mesmerizing blend of coconut palms, sandy shores, and azure waters.Throughout this 
				journey, each halt is a window into India's diversity, with its myriad languages, cuisines, and traditions. 
				Arriving at Kanyakumari, where the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, and Indian Ocean converge, passengers 
				witness the culmination of a voyage that unites India's geographical and cultural extremes.
